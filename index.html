<h2 class="titles">About This Site</h2>
<p class="words" id="about">This site isn't just for sloths. I don't know what it is about yet, so don't ask. All I know is that I have a website now that I am making with html (its a coding language, if you don't know). Also I am a horrible speller so please don't judge.</p>
<h2 class="titles">About Sloths</h2>
<p class="words" id="facts">Sloths are nocturnal animals. And despite what most people think sloths only sleep for 10 hours a day. Since their diet consists of mostly leafs, they don't have that much energy throughout the day. And when they are hanging from a branch and start to climb, they sometimes grab onto their own arm thinking its a branch and fall to their death. Its sad but true. They can also continue to hang onto the branch they were on after death.</p>

<h2 class="titles" id="idk">I Dont Even Know Anymore</h2>
<p class="words">I don't know what this is. I'm so bored, and I have nothing else to do. Well I do have things to do, but I don't want to do it right now. Sloths are my favorite animal and that's why this website is mostly about sloths. I mean heck, it could have been about school or something. It seems like I'm always bored though. And please don't read this and think "Oh wow she is a horrible speller" because I know I am. And if you have any other problems with my website, you try coding a website with HTML with little experience. I don't know if people will actually be on my website though, I hope so because I really like to program using HTML. But whatever, ya know. So what if no one sees this website. This is mostly so I get some practice coding. Because this is very fun for me and I want to learn more about coding. </p>

<p class="words">Im sorry but i dont know who it is by. I did not draw it and I am sorry that I can't credit anyone. I just found it by searching for public domain pictures.</p>
<span title="Random News"><marquee id="news"><em id="BreakingNews"><strong>Breaking News:</em> I am so very bored. Also sloths are adorable. Deal with it. I am cool, I am the coolest, I am the coolest cat. Don't ask what that means, because I have no idea. That sentence was the essence of my life</strong></marquee></span>
