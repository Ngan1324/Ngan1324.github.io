<h2 class="titles">About This Site</h2>
<p class="words" id="about">This site isn't just for sloths. I don't know what it is about yet, so don't ask. All I know is that I have a website now <br>that I am making with html (its a coding language, if you don't know). Also I am a horrible speller so please don't judge.</p>
<h2 class="titles">About Sloths</h2>
<p class="words" id="random1">Sloths are nocturnal animals.And despite what most people think sloths only sleep for 10 hours a day. Since their diet <br>consists of mostly leafs, they don't have that much energy throughout the day. And when they are hanging from a branch <br>and start to climb, they sometimes grab onto their own arm thinking its a branch and fall to their death. Its sad but true. They can also continue to hang onto the branch they were on after death.</p>
