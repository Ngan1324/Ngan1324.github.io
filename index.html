<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p id="about">This site isn't just for sloths. I don't know what it is about yet, so don't ask. All I know is that I have a website now <br>that I am making with html (its a coding language, if you don't know). Also I am a horrible speller so please don't judge.<br> It might just be a place where I put my thoughts and feelings or something.</p>
<h2>Random Thing For The Day</h2>
<p id="random1">I am very bored right now and this is all I have to do at the moment.<br> Right now all Im doing is writing this and watching Friends (the show) and its so cringy! I mean its so bad. Have you <br>ever watched something that hurt? Thats what its like to watch this sometimes. Its a good show though and you should defiantly<br> watch it.</p>
